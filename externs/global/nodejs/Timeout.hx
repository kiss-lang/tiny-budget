	This object is created internally and is returned from `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`. It can be passed to either `clearTimeout()` or `clearInterval()` in order to cancel the
	scheduled actions.

	timer is active. Each of the `Timeout` objects returned by these functions
	export both `timeout.ref()` and `timeout.unref()` functions that can be used to
	control this default behavior.
